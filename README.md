# Coyote Framework

The Coyote Framework is a framework for functional testing.  Leveraging both Selenium and Python Requests,
it delivers repeatable, reliable, and easy to change tests, reducing downward pressure on both development and
testing.

More docs, including examples, will be coming up next.
